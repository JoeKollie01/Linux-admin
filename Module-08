System Run Level
===================

System Run Levels

    Main Run level with init
    ----------------------------
    - 0 - shutdown (or halt) the system
    - 1 - single-user mode; usually aliased as s or S
    - 6 - Reboot the system

    Other Run levels
    ------------------

    2 - multiuser mode without networking
    3 - multiuser mode with networking
    5 - multiuser mode with networking and GUI

    Note: run-level 4 is undefined or not used/User-definable

Computer Boot Process
=====================

When the computer boot >  The CPU starts & pulls instructions from the BIOS software > ROM  > CMOS battery = complementary metal-oxide semi-conductor  - it has BIOS settings including system time, date as well as hardware settings

 > POST ( Power on self test)

 Linux Boot Process
 =======================

    BIOS - executes MBR

    MBR - executes GRUB

    GRUB - executes kernel

    Kernel - executes /sbin/init

    Init - executes runlevel programs

    Runlevel - execute from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/

Message of the Day
====================

Message of the day file location

    - /etc/motd


Customize Message of the Day
==============================

Once again, message of the day is the first message users will see when they login to the Linux machine

Steps:

Create a new file in /etc/profile.d/motd.sh
Add desired commands in motd.sh file
Modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to edit
    #PrintMotd yes to PrintMotd no
    Restart sshd service
        -systemctl restart sshd.service


Computer Storage
====================

Local Storage
    -RAM, HDD, SSD etc

DAS (Direct Attached Storage)
    -CD/DVD, USB flash drive, external disk directly attached with
    USB or other cables

SAN (Storage Area Network)
    - Storage attached through iSCSI or fiber cable

NAS (Network Attached Storage)

    -Storage attached over network (TCP/IP)
    -E.g Samba, NFS etc

Disk Partition
==============

Commands for disk partition
    -df
    -fdisk

Adding Disk and Creating Partition
================================
Purpose = Out of Space, Additional Apps etc


Logical Volume Management
===========================

LVM allows disks to be combined together


Add Disk and Create LVM Partition 
==================================

File System = datafs
Logical Volume(s) = datalv
Volume Group = datavg
Physical Volume = /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
Partitions = /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
Hard Disks = /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
