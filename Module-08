System Run Level
===================

System Run Levels

    Main Run level with init
    ----------------------------
    - 0 - shutdown (or halt) the system
    - 1 - single-user mode; usually aliased as s or S
    - 6 - Reboot the system

    Other Run levels
    ------------------

    2 - multiuser mode without networking
    3 - multiuser mode with networking
    5 - multiuser mode with networking and GUI

    Note: run-level 4 is undefined or not used/User-definable

Computer Boot Process
=====================

When the computer boot >  The CPU starts & pulls instructions from the BIOS software > ROM  > CMOS battery = complementary metal-oxide semi-conductor  - it has BIOS settings including system time, date as well as hardware settings

 > POST ( Power on self test)

 Linux Boot Process
 =======================

    BIOS - executes MBR

    MBR - executes GRUB

    GRUB - executes kernel

    Kernel - executes /sbin/init

    Init - executes runlevel programs

    Runlevel - execute from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/

Message of the Day
====================

Message of the day file location

    - /etc/motd


Customize Message of the Day
==============================

Once again, message of the day is the first message users will see when they login to the Linux machine

Steps:

Create a new file in /etc/profile.d/motd.sh
Add desired commands in motd.sh file
Modify the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to edit
    #PrintMotd yes to PrintMotd no
    Restart sshd service
        -systemctl restart sshd.service


Computer Storage
====================

Local Storage
    -RAM, HDD, SSD etc

DAS (Direct Attached Storage)
    -CD/DVD, USB flash drive, external disk directly attached with
    USB or other cables

SAN (Storage Area Network)
    - Storage attached through iSCSI or fiber cable

NAS (Network Attached Storage)

    -Storage attached over network (TCP/IP)
    -E.g Samba, NFS etc

Disk Partition
==============

Commands for disk partition
    -df
    -fdisk

Adding Disk and Creating Partition
================================
Purpose = Out of Space, Additional Apps etc


Logical Volume Management
===========================

LVM allows disks to be combined together


Add Disk and Create LVM Partition 
==================================

File System = datafs
Logical Volume(s) = datalv
Volume Group = datavg
Physical Volume = /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
Partitions = /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
Hard Disks = /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

Add and Extend Disk using LVM
==============================

-Delete files to free up disk space
-Add new physical disk mount to /oracle2
-Create a new virtual disk and mount to /oracle2
-Or extend /oracle throguh LVM

Add/Extend Swap Space
========================

What is swap ?

    - is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory


Recommended swap size = Twice the size of RAM
    M = Amount of RAM in GB, and S = Amount of swap in GB, then

    if M < 2  
    then   S = M * 2
    Else   S = M + 2

    Commands 
        - dd
        - mkswap
        - swapon or swapoff


Implement Advanced Storage Features
======================================

RedHat 8 introduces the next generation volume management solution called Stratis

It uses thin provisioning by default

It combines the process of creating logical volume management (LVM) and creation of filesystems into one management

In LVM if a filesystem system gets full you will have to extend it manually whereas stratis extends the filesystem automatically if it has available space in its pool

Install Stratis package
    -yum/dnf install stratis-cli stratisd

Enable and start Stratis service
    - systemctl enable | start stratisd

Add 2x 5G new disk from virtualization software and verify at the OS level
    -oracle virtualbox storage setting lsblk

Create a new stratis pool and verify
    -stratis pool create pool1 /dev/sdb
    stratis pool list

Extend the pool
    -stratis pool add-data pool1 /dev/sdc
    - stratis pool list

Create a new filesystem using stratis
    stratis filesystem create pool1 fs1
    stratis filesystem list

Create a directory for mount point and mount filesystem
    mkdir /bigdata
    mount  /dev/stratis/pool1/fs1 /bigdata
    lsblk

Create a snapshot of your filesystem
    stratis filesystem snapshot pool1 fs1 fs1-snap
    stratis filesystem list

Add the entry to /etc/fstab to mount at boot

    -UUID="asf-0887afgddja-" /bigdata xfs defaults, x-
    systemd.requires-stratisd.service 0 0

RAID
======

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

Type of RAID
============
RAID 0
RAID 1
RAID 5


File System Check (fsck and xfs_repair)
=========================================

Linux fsck utility is used to check and repair Linux filesystems
(ext2 ext3 ext4 etc)

Linux xfs_repair utility is used to check and repair Linux
filesystems for xfs filesystem type

Depending on when was the last time a filesystem was checked, the system runs the fsck during boot time to check whether the filesystem is in consistent state


System Backup (dd Command)
==============================

5 Different Types of Backups
-----------------------------
1. System backup (entire image using tools such as acronis, Veeam, Commvault etc)

2.Application backup (3rd party application backup solution)

3.Database backup (Oracle dataguard, SQL backup etc)

4. Filesystem backup (tar, gzip directories etc)

5. Disk backup or disk cloning (dd command)

dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files

As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot  sector of a hard drive, and obtaining a fixed amount of random data

To backup or clone an entire hard disk to another connected to the same system, execute the dd command as shown

# dd if=<source file name> of=<target file name> [Options]

# dd if =/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb

To backup/copy the disk partition 

# dd if =/dev/sda1 of=/root/sda1.img

Restoring this image file to other machine after copying the img

# dd if=/root/sda1.img of=/dev/sdb3

Network File System (NFS)
==========================

NFS stands for Network File System, a file system developed by Sun Microsystems Inc.

It is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory


Install NFS packages

# yum install nfs-utils libnfsidmap

Once the packages are installed enable and start NFS services

# systemctl enable rpcbind
# systemctl enable nfs-server
# systemctl start rpcbind, nfs-server, rpc-statd, nfs-idmaps

Create NFS share directory and assign permissions

#mkdir /mypretzels
#chmod a+rwx /mypretzels

Modify /etc/exports file to add new shared filesystem

# /mypretzels 192.168.12.7 (rw sync , no_root_squash) = for only 1 host

# /mypretzels * (rw, sync , no_root_squash) = for everyone
