Important Things to Remember in Linux
=======================================
    - Linux has super-user account called root
    Root - is the most powerful account that can create, modify, delete accounts and make changes to system configuration files

    - Linux is case-sensitive system
        - ABC is NOT same as abc 
    
    - Avoid using spaces when creating files and directories

    - Linux kernel is not an operating system. It is a small software within Linux operating
    system that takes commands from users and pass them to system hardware or peripherals

    - Linux is mostly CLI not GUI

    - Linux is very flexible as compared to other operating systems


    Access to  Linux system
    =============================

    There are 3 types of Access
        - console
        - Remote

    The console is a direct access to an operating system when it is connected through VGA, HDMI, DVI etc

    The 2^nd type of access is remote where you connect to your operating system remotely over the network


    Getting an I.P Address in Linux
    =================================

    - In the terminal  run ----- ifconfig
         
         -latter version of CentOs may not have the "ifconfig" instead install the following before using "ip addr"

         run yum install net-tools

    
    Command Prompts and Getting Prompts Back
    ========================================

    What are command Prompts
        - a command prompt, also referred to simply as a prompt, is a short text at 
        the start of the command line followed by prompt symbol on a command line interface

    
    Command to get a hostname
    ============================
        - whoami

    
    Intro o Filesystem
    =========================
    What is a Filesystem?
        - it is a system used by operating system to manage files.The system controls how data is saved or retrieved

    Operating system stores files and directories in an organized and structured way
        -System configuration files
        -User files
        -Log files
        -Commands or scripts
    
    There are many different types of filesystems. In general, improvements have been made to filesystems with new releases of operating systems and each new Filesystem
    has been given a different name
        - ext3, ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT etc

    
    
    File System Structure and its Descriptions
    ===========================================

    /boot - contains file that is used by the boot loader (grub.cfg)
    /root - root user home directory. It is not same as /
    /dev -  system devices (e.g disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboard etc)
    /etc - configuration files
    /bin --- /usr/bin - everyday user commands
    /sbin --- /usr/sbin - system/filesystem commands
    /opt - optional add-on applications (Not part of OS apps) mostly third-party apps
    /proc - running processes (only exist in Memory)
    /lib --- usr/lib - C programming library files needed by commands and apps
                    strace -e open pwd
    /tmp - directory for  temporary files
    /home - directory for user
    /var - system logs
    /run - system daemons that start very early (e.g systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
    /mnt - to mount external filesystem (e.g NFS)
    /media - for cdrom mounts


    Navigating File System
    =======================

    When navigating a Unix filesystem, there are a few important commands

    "cd"
    "pwd"
    "ls"

    - cd = stands for change directory. It is the primary commands for moving you around the filesystem
    - pwd = stands for print working directory. It tells you where current location is
    - ls  = stands for list. It lists all the directories/files within a current working directory

    To switch to root account
    ==============================
     = su -

    
    / directory
    =================
    It is a parent directory

    Note!!!
     anything that start with a dash " - " mean it is a file
     anything with a "d" mean it a directory
     while " l" mean it is a link

    cd ..
    ========
    it takes you one directory back

   Linux File or Directory Properties
   ===================================

   Each file or directory in Linux has detail information or Properties

   Type 
   =====
   drwxr-xr-x
   lrwxrwxrwx
   -rw-r-r--

   # of links

Linux File Type
=================

-  = regular file
d  = directory
l  = link
c = special file or device file
s  = socket
p =  Named pipe 
b = Block device


What is Root
================

There are 3 type of root on Linux system

- Root account: root is an account or a username on Linux machine and it is the most powerful account which has access to all commands and files
- Root as / : the very first directory in Linux is also referred as root directory
- Root home directory : the root user account also has a directory located in  / root which is called root home directory

Changing Password
======================
- Change the initial password as soon as you login

Command = passwd userid

Old password : enter your current password
New password: enter new password
Retype new password: -re-enter the new password

File System Paths
=======================
There are two paths to navigate to a filesystem
    -Absolute Path
    -Relative Path

An absolute path always begins with a "/" . This indicates that the path starts at the root directory.
Example of an absolute path is

    cd /var/log/samba

A relative path does not begin with a "/" . It identifies a location relative to the current position.
Example of a relative path is

    cd /var
    cd log
    cd samba


Check User Existence
=====================

Command : grep username /etc/passwd


Creating Files and directories
=================================

Commands for Creating Files

    -touch
    -cp 
    -vi

Commands for Creating directories
==================================

    -mkdir

Command(s) to list files and dir when it was last modified
============================================================
    - ls -ltr

Command to copy file(s) and renew it
=========================================
    cp filename newfilename

Command to create vi file(s)
=============================
    - vi homer
        it will open up vi editor type in :wq!

Command to create directories
==============================
    mkdir seinfield

Copying directories
========================
Command to copy a directory
    - cp

To copy a directory on Linux, you have to execute the "cp" command with the "-R" option for recursive
and specify the source and destination directories to be copied

    - cp -R <source_folder> <destination_folder>

    To renew and copy use this below command
    =========================================
        cp -R <source_folder> <destination_folder>/<newfolder_name


Find Files and directories
==================================

Two main commands are used to find files/directories in Linux

    -find
    -locate

    Using the "Find" command to get a file/directory
    ===================================================

        find . -name "file or dir"

        . = indicate the search is done within the current directory (e.g /home)
         / = indicate the parent or root directories

    Note: If "locate" command does not output any result, then as root run "updatedb"
    Also make sure you have "mlocate" package installed

    To check = rpm -qa | grep mlocate

    To install = yum install mlocate

Difference between find and locate
==================================
    - "locate" uses a prebuilt database, which should be regularly updated while "find" iterates over a filesystem to 
    locate files. Thus. locate is much faster than find, but can be inaccurate if the database (can be seen as a cache) is not updated

    - To update locate database run "updatedb"


WILDCARDS
==================
A wildcard is a character that can be used as a substitute for any of a class of characters in a search

* = represents zero or more characters
? = represents a single character
[] = represents a range of characters
