Commands Syntax
===================

* Command options and arguments

Commands typically have the syntax:
    command option(s) argument(s)


options

Modify the way that a command works
Usually consist of a hyphen (-) or dash followed by a single letter
Some commands accept multiple options which usually be grouped together after a single hyphen

arguments

Most commands are used together with one or more arguments
Some commands assume a default argument if none is supplied
Arguments are optional for some commands and required by others


File Permissions
=================
Unix is a multi-user system.Every file and directory in your account can be protected from or made accessible to other users by changing its access permissions.
Every user has responsibility for controlling access to their files

*Permissions for a file or directory may be restricted to by types

*There are 3 type of permissions
    - r = read 
    - w = write
    - x = execute - running a programming

Each permission (rwx) can be controlled at three levels

    - u - user = yourself
    - g - group = can be people in the same project
    - o  - other = everyone on the system

File or Directory permission can be displayed by running ls -l command
    -rwxrwxrwx

Command to change permission
    - chmod

    command to remove file permission for everyone 
        - chmod a-rwx filename

Permission Using Numeric modified
=====================================
    Permission to a file and directory can also be assigned numerically
        -chmod ugo + r File

        Or -chmod 444 File

                -r--r--r--

Owners assigned Permission On Every File and directory

    User ==============> Read, Write, Execute
    Group ==============> Read, Write, Execute
    All ================> Read, Write, 
    
The table below assigns numbers to permissions type

Numbers         Permission type         Symbol
0               No Permission           ---
1               Execute                 --x
2               Write                   -w-
3               Execute + Write         -wx
4               Read                    r--
5               Read + Execute          r-x
6               Read + Write            rw-
7               Read+Write+Execute      rwx


Command "Chmod" => change file mode bits/permissions


File Ownership
===============
 There are 2 owners of a file or directory
    -User and group

Command to change file Ownership
    -chown and chgrp
    *chown = changes the ownership of a file
    *chgrp = changes the group ownership of a file

Recursive ownership change option (Cascade)

    -R

Access Control List (ACL)
============================

What is ACL
    - Access control list provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism
    for file systems. It is designed to assist with UNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions
    for any user or group to any disc resource

Use of ACL
    Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of group created by you
    but still you want to give some read or write access how can you do it without making user a member of group
    ,here comes in picture Access Control List, ACL helps us to do this trick

    Basically, ACL are used to make a flexible permission mechanism in Linux

    From Linux man pages, ACL are used to define more fine-grained discretionary access
    rights for files and directories

    Commands to assign and remove ACL permissions are:

        - setfacl and getfacl

        getfacl = provide more information about the file

    List of commands for setting up ACL:

    1) To add permission for user
        - setfacl -m u:user:rwx /path/to/file

    2) To add permissions for a group
        - setfacl -m g:group:rw  /path/to/file
    
    3) To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
        - setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/to/dir

    4) To remove a specific entry
        - setfacl -x u:user /path/to/file (For a specific user)
    
    5) To remove all entries
        -setfacl -b path/to/file (For all users)

    Note:
        As you assign the ACL permission to a file/directory it adds + sign at the end of the permission
        Setting w permission with ACL does not allow to remove a file

Help Commands
====================

    - There are 3 types of help commands

        - whatis command
        -command --help
        - man command


TAB Completion and Up arrow
==============================

Hitting TAB key completes the available commands files or directories
    -chm TAB
    - ls j<TAB>
    - cd Des<TAB>

Hitting up arrow key on the keyboard returns the last command ran

Adding Text to Files (Redirects)
================================
3 Simple ways to add text to a file
    -vi
    -Redirect command output > or >>
    -echo > or >>

Note: To add more text to a file via the terminal, " >> " instead of ">" .
 The ">" will overwrite the content of the file

Input and Output redirects
===========================
There are 3 redirects in Linux
    - Standard input (stdin) and it has file descriptor number as 0
    - Standard output (stdout) and it has file descriptor number as 1
    - Standard error (stderr) and it has descriptor number as 2

Output (stdout) - 1
    By default when running a command its output goes to the terminal
    The output of a command can be routed to a file using > symbol
        E.g
        - ls -l > listings
        - pwd > findpath
    
    If using the same file for additional output or to append to the same file then use >>
        E.g
        -ls -la >> listings
        - echo "Hello World" >> findpath

Input (stdin) - 0

    Input is used when feeding file contents to a file
        E.g
        - cat < listings
        - mail -s "Office memo" allusers@abc.com < memoletter

Error(stderr) - 2

    What a command is executed we use a keyboard and that is also considered (stdin -0)
    That command output goes on the monitor and that output is (stdout -1)
    If the command produced any error on the screen then it is considered (stderr - 2)

        We can use redirects to route errors from the screen
            - E.g  ls -l /root 2> errorfile
