NIC
=======
NIC = Network Interface Card

    example ethtool enp0s3

Other NICs
    lo = The loopback device is a special interface that your device use to communicate with itself. It is used mainly for daignostics and troubleshooting and to connect to servers running on the local machine

    virb0 = The virbr0 or virtual bridge 0 interface is used for NAT (Network Address Translation). Virtual environments sometimes use it to connect to the outside network

NIC Bonding
=================
NIC = Network Interface Card (PC or laptop)

NIC(Network Interface Card) bonding is also known as Network bonding. It can be defined as the aggregation or combination of multiple NIC into a single bond interface.

It is main purpose is to provide high availability and redundancy

New Network utilities
=====================
Network configuration methods
    -nmtui
    -nmcli
    -nm-connection-editor
    -GNOME 

Getting Started with Network Manager
    NetworkManager is a service that provides set of tools designed specifically to make it easier to manage the networking configuration on Linux systems and is the default network management service on RHEL 8 & 9

    - It makes network management easier
    -It provides easy setup of connection to the user
    -NetworkManager offers management through different tools such as GUI, nmtui, and nmcli

    Network configuration methods
    ==================================

    nmcli - short for network manager command line interface. This tool is useful when access to a graphical environment is not available and can also be used within scripts to makes network configuration changes

    nmtui - short for network manager text user interface. This tool can be run within any terminal and allows changes to be made by menu selections and entering data

    nm-connection-editor = a full graphical management tool providing access to most of the NetworkManager configuration options. It can only be accessed through the desktp or console

    GNOME Settings = the network screen of the GNOME desktop setting application allow basic network management tasks to be performed

Download Files or Apps
=======================

wget = the non-interactive network downloader

Linux = wget
    - Example in Linux
        wget http://website.com/filename

Why
    Most of the servers in corporate
    environment do NOT have internet access


curl and ping Commands
=========================

Linux = curl

Linux = ping

Example in Linux
    -curl http://website.com/filename
    -curl -O http://website.com/filename

    ping  www.pdcc.io


FTP - File Transfer Protocol
=============================

The File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architectur using separate control and data connections between the client and the server

Protocol = Set of rules used by computers to communicate

Default FTP Port = 21

For lab we need  2 Linux machines

    -Client = practice
    -Server = test

Install and configure FTP on the remote server
==============================================
    # Become root
    # rpm -qa | grep ftp
    # ping google.com
    # yum install vsftpd
    # vi /etc/vsftpd.conf     (make a copy first)
        - cp vsftpd.conf vsftpd.conf.orig


    Find the following line and makes the changes shown below
    #Disable anonymous login##
        -anonymous_enable=NO
    
    #Uncomment##
        -ascii_upload_enable=YES
        -ascii_download_enable=YES
    
    ##Uncomment - Enter you Welcome message - This is optional##
        - ftpd_banner=Welcome to UNIXMEN FTP service
    
    ##Add at the end of this file##
        - use_localtime=YES

    #systemctl start vsftpd
    #systemctl enable vsftpd
    #systemctl stop firewalld
    #systemctl disable firewalld
    # useradd JoeKollie (if the user does not exist)

Install FTP client on the client server
======================================

    #Become root
    #yum install ftp
    #su - username
    $ touch kruger


Commands to transfer file to the FTP server
============================================

    ftp 192.168.0.x
    Enter username and password
    bi
    hash
    put kruger
    bye


SCP - Secure Copy Protocol
============================

The Secure Copy Protocol or SCP helps to transfer computer files securely from a local to a remote host. It is somewhat similar to the File Transfer Protocol "FTP" but it adds security and authentication

Protocol = Set of rules used by computers to communicate

Default SCP Port = 22 (same as SSH)

For this lecture we need  2 Linux machines

    -Client = practice
    -Server = test

Procedure:

SCP Commands to transfer file to the remote server
==================================================

Login as yourself
touch filename
scp filename test@192.168.0.x:/home/test
Enter username and password



rsync - Remote Synchronization
===================================
rsync - is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing  files within the same computer or to a remote computer by comparing the modification times and sizes of files.

    -rsync is a lot faster than ftp or scp

    - This utility is mostly used to backup the files and directories from one server to another

    Default rsync Port = 22 (same as SSH)

        -Exercise: 2 Linux machines are require
            Client = practice
            Server = test

Basic syntax of rsync command
    #rsync options source destination

Install rsync in your Linux machine (check if it already exists)
    #yum install rsync (On CentOS/Redhat based systems)
    #apt-get install rsync (On Ubuntu/Debian based systems)

rsync a file on a local machine

    $tar cvf backup.tar (tar the entire home (home/test))
    $mkdir /tmp/backups
    $rsync -zvh backup.tar /tmp/backups/

rsync a directory on a local machine
    $rsync -azvh /home/test /tmp/backups/

rsync a file to a remote machine
    $mkdir /tmp/backups (create /tmp/backups dir on remote server)
    rsync -avz backup.tar test@192.168.0.x:/tmp/backups

rsync a file from a remote machine
    $touch serverfile
    $rsync -avzh test@192.168.0.x:/home/test/serverfile /tmp/backups


System Updates and Repos
==========================

yum (CentOS), apt-get(other Linux)

rpm (Red hat Package Manager) - is used when you already have a package download on your system and can be used to install the package locally. It is mostly used in an environment where there is no internet access

yum - download and install the package(s)

System Upgrade/Patch Management
================================

There are two type of upgrades

    Major version = 5,6,7

Major version = yum command (cannot be upgraded using the yum command)

Minor version = yum update

Example:
    yum update -y

yum update vs. upgrade

upgrade = delete packages

update = preserve

Create local Repository from DVD
======================================

What is local repository ?
    - is a repository that hold all of your local rpm packages locally

Command
    -createrepo

Advance Package Management
==============================

Rollback Updates and Patches
============================
Virtual machine
Physical machine

Rollback a package or patch
    - yum install <package-name>
    - yum history undo <id>

Rollback an update

    Downgrading a system to minor version (ex RHEL 7.1 to RHEL 7.0) is not recommended as this might leave the system in undesired or unstable state

    yum update = Update will preserve the 
    yum upgrade = upgrade will delete obsolete packages
    yum history undo <id>

SSH AND Telnet
=====================

Telnet = unsecured connection between computers
SSH = Secured

Two type of packages for most of the services

    -Client package
    -Server package

It is a replacement for old traditional date command

The timedatectl command shows/change date,time and timezone

It synchronizes the time with NTP server as well

    You can either use chronyd or ntpd and make the ntp setting in timedatectl as yes

    Or you can use systemd-timesyncd daemon to synchronize time is a replacement for ntpd and chronyd

Note : Redhat/CentOS does not provide this in daemon in its standard repo. You will have to download it separately

    -

OpenLDAP Service
    - slapd

Start or Stop the service
    - systemctl start slapd
    - systemctl enable slapd

Configuration Files
    -/etc/openldap/slapd.d
    
Trace Network Traffic (traceroute)
====================================

The traceroute command is used in Linux to map the journey that a packet of information undertakes from its source to its destination. One use for traceroute is to locate when data loss occurs throughout a network, which could signify a node that's down.

Because each hop in the record reflects a new server or router between the originating PC and the intended target, reviewing the results of a traceroute scan also lets you identify slow points that may adversely affect your network traffic.


Example

# traceroute www.google.com


How to Open an Image File
==========================

Become root

dnf install GraphicsMagic

display image-

Configure and secure SSH
========================

SSH

    - SSH stand for secure shell - provides you with an interface to the Linux system. It takes in your commands and translate them to kernel to manage hardware


OpenSSH is a package/software

Its service daemon is sshd

SSH port # 22

SSH itself is secure, meaning communication through SSH is always encrypted but there should be some additional configuration can be done to make it more secure 
Following are the most common configuration an administrator should take to secure SSH

Configure Idle Timeout Interval

Avoid having an unattended SSH session you can set an Idle timeout interval

Become root
Edit your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add the following line
ClientAliveInterval 600
ClientAliveCountMax 0
# systemctl restart sshd

The idle timeout interval you are setting is in seconds (600 secs = 10 minutes). Once the interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out.


Access Remote Server without Password(SSH-Key)
==============================================

Two reasons to access a remote machine
    -Repetitive logins
    -Automation through scripts

Keys are generated at user level
    -test
    -root

Process for client
===================
Step 1 - Generate the Key
# ssh-keygen

Step 2 - Copy the Key to the server

# ssh-copy-id root@I.P address

Step 3 - Loging from client to server
# ssh root@I.P address
# ssh -l root I.P address


Cockpit
==============
Cockpit is a server administration tool Red Hat, focused on providing a modern-looking and user-friendly interface to manage and administer servers

Cockpit is the easy to use integrated glanceable and open web-based interface for your servers

The application is available in most of the Linux distributions such as CentOS, Redhat, Ubuntu and Fedora

It is installed in Redhat 8 by default and it is optional in version 7

It can monitor system resources add or remove accounts, monitor system usage shut down the system and perform quite a few other tasks all through a very accessible web connection

Introduction to Firewall
==========================

What is Firewall
    - a wall that prevents the spread of fire


When data moves in and out of a server its packet information is tested against the firewall rules to see if its should be allowed or not

In simple words, a firewall is like a watchman, a bouncer, or shield that has a set of rules given and based on that rules they decide who can enter and leave


There are 2 type of firewalls in IT

    - Software = runs on operating system
    - Hardware = a dedicated appliance with firewall software


There are 2 tools to manage firewall in most of the Linux distributions
    -iptables = for  older Linux versions but still widely used
    -firewalld = for newer versions like 7 and up

You can run one or the other
    
Before working with iptables make sure firewalld is not running and disable it

    -service OR systemctl stop firewalld = to stop the service
    -systemctl disable firewalld = to prevent from starting at boot
    -systemctl mask forewalld = to prevent if from running by other programs
