Network Components
===================
IP
subnet mask
Gateway
Static vs DHCP
interface
Interface MAC Address

Network Files and Commands
==========================
Interface Detection
Assigning an IP Address
Interface configuration files
    /etc/nsswitch.conf
    /etc/hosts
    /etc/sysconfig/network
    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-nic
    /etc/resolv.conf

Network Commands
===================
ping
ifconfig
ifup or ifdown
netstat
tcpdump

NIC
=======
NIC = Network Interface Card

    example ethtool enp0s3

Other NICs
    lo = The loopback device is a special interface that your device use to communicate with itself. It is used mainly for daignostics and troubleshooting and to connect to servers running on the local machine

    virb0 = The virbr0 or virtual bridge 0 interface is used for NAT (Network Address Translation). Virtual environments sometimes use it to connect to the outside network

NIC Bonding
=================
NIC = Network Interface Card (PC or laptop)

NIC(Network Interface Card) bonding is also known as Network bonding. It can be defined as the aggregation or combination of multiple NIC into a single bond interface.

It is main purpose is to provide high availability and redundancy

NIC Bonding Procedure
=====================
modprobe bonding
modinfo bonding
Create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0
Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet1
Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ethernet2

New Network utilities
=====================
Network configuration methods
    -nmtui
    -nmcli
    -nm-connection-editor
    -GNOME 

Getting Started with Network Manager
    NetworkManager is a service that provides set of tools designed specifically to make it easier to manage the networking configuration on Linux systems and is the default network management service on RHEL 8 & 9

    - It makes network management easier
    -It provides easy setup of connection to the user
    -NetworkManager offers management through different tools such as GUI, nmtui, and nmcli

    Network configuration methods
    ==================================

    nmcli - short for network manager command line interface. This tool is useful when access to a graphical environment is not available and can also be used within scripts to makes network configuration changes

    nmtui - short for network manager text user interface. This tool can be run within any terminal and allows changes to be made by menu selections and entering data

    nm-connection-editor = a full graphical management tool providing access to most of the NetworkManager configuration options. It can only be accessed through the desktp or console

    GNOME Settings = the network screen of the GNOME desktop setting application allow basic network management tasks to be performed

Download Files or Apps
=======================

wget = the non-interactive network downloader

Linux = wget
    - Example in Linux
        wget http://website.com/filename

Why
    Most of the servers in corporate
    environment do NOT have internet access


curl and ping Commands
=========================

Linux = curl

Linux = ping

Example in Linux
    -curl http://website.com/filename
    -curl -O http://website.com/filename

    ping  www.pdcc.io


FTP - File Transfer Protocol
=============================

The File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architectur using separate control and data connections between the client and the server

Protocol = Set of rules used by computers to communicate

Default FTP Port = 21

For lab we need  2 Linux machines

    -Client = practice
    -Server = test
